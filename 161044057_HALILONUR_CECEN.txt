Denial of Service (DOS) Attacks:
Denial of service is a type of attack that continuously sends requests to a server. Denial of service is typically accomplished by flooding the targeted machine or resource with superfluous requests in an attempt to overload systems and prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled. It is analogous to a group of people crowding the entry door or gate to a shop or business, and not letting legitimate parties enter into the shop or business, disrupting normal operations. Servers mostly cant distinguish whether a request is attack or original user. And that situation makes it hard to defend.
